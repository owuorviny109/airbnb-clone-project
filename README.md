##  More UI/UX Design Planning

### 1. **Color Styles**

| Name             | Hex       |
|------------------|-----------|
| Primary Color    | #FF5A5F   |
| Secondary Color  | #008489   |
| Background       | #FFFFFF   |
| Text             | #222222   |
| Secondary Text   | #717171   |

### 2. **Typography**

| Type             | Font Family | Weight  | Size   |
|------------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Primary Font     | Circular    | Medium  | 16px   |
| Headings         | Circular    | Bold    | 24â€“32px|

### 3. **Importance of Identifying Design Properties**

Extracting and implementing design tokens (e.g., color codes, font weights, sizes) from Figma ensures pixel-perfect design translation, visual consistency, and development efficiency. This approach reduces errors, speeds up changes, and supports scalability.
